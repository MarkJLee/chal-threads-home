# chal-threads-home

This project replicates a segment of the Home screen from the Threads application.

## Specifications

### Home Screen

-   Implement a scrollable list to display posts.

### Post Component

-   Posts should be differentiated into two categories: textual and visual (with images).
-   For posts containing images, ensure swipe functionality for user navigation.
-   The design should closely mirror the original representation.

### Navigation

-   Integrate a navigation bar comprising five tabs: Home, Search, Write Thread, Notifications, and Profile.
-   Highlight the active tab with a black icon; inactive tabs should display a grey icon.
-   Utilize a Placeholder for non-implemented screens.

### Bottom Sheet

-   When the user taps the "•••" icon, a sliding panel(BottomSheet) should come from below.
-   This sliding panel should include options for "Unfollow", "Mute", "Hide", and "Report".
-   Tapping the "Report" option should navigate the user to a new view within the sliding panel.
-   This Report view should feature a title bar and a series of list items.
