# chal-threads-home

This project replicates a segment of the Home screen from the Threads application.

## Specifications

### Home Screen

-   Implement a scrollable list to display posts.

### Post Component

-   Posts should be differentiated into two categories: textual and visual (with images).
-   For posts containing images, ensure swipe functionality for user navigation.
-   The design should closely mirror the original representation.

### Navigation

-   Integrate a navigation bar comprising five tabs: Home, Search, Write Thread, Notifications, and Profile.
-   Highlight the active tab with a black icon; inactive tabs should display a grey icon.
-   Utilize a Placeholder for non-implemented screens.
